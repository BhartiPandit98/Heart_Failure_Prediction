# Heart Failure Prediction: Project Overview
- I built a tool that predicts the possibilty of heart failure in a person to slow down the disease progression and improve pateint outcomes
- Scraped clinincal and lifestyle data of over 300 persons

# Code and Resources Used
- Python Version: 3.7
- Packages: Pandas, numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, seaborn
- Scaper data: https://github.com/BhartiPandit98/Heart_Failure_Prediction/blob/main/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv

# Dataset Description
- Age
- Anaemia
- Creatinine Phosphokinase
- Diabetes
- Ejection Fraction
- High Blood Pressure
- Platelets
- Serum Sodium
- Sex
- Smoking
- Time
- Death Event

# Data Cleaning

- Converted the different chemical levels to low, medium and high
- Converted the age group as adult and senior citizen

# EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights:
